\chapter{Introduction}

The most of this report is based on the two books, A Course in Functional Analysis and A Course in Operator Theory by John B. Conway. However, I reorgnized the contents under my understanding and added some other materials to help me understand the structure of the knowledge of the fundamental operator theory.

 My understanding of this structure is based on "General-to-special" order. Like, we firstly research the general space, and then by adding more other structure on it, we get a more special space with more interesting properties. Conversely, these properties also revealed the essential traits of the more special space. Then we can strengthen the traits the special space has, thus a more special space is born. Using this order, the appearance of $\st{C}$-algebra and von Neumann algebra is very nature for me.

 Firstly, I have seen the structure of finite dimensional linear space, but how to research the infinite dimensional linear space is a question. Clearly, the algebraic structure cannot provide enough information about the infinite dimension. However, by learning topological spaces, I know that the topology can provide a method to research the infinite sets, thus equipping the infinite dimensional linear space with an appropriate topology is a good ideal. Naturally, this topology should be compatible with the original linear structure. Therefore, topological vector spaces is important, and there are many interesting properties generated by the merge of the topology and the algebra. If the topology of the T.V.S. can be more special, like the pre-"length" of elements is continuous with respect to the topology, then we get a locally convex topological vector space with more interesting properties than the general T.V.S. has. When learning the finite dimensional linear space, I saw the corresponding dual space is very "like" with the original space. But how do these properties change in the infinite dimensional case? The Hahn-Banach Theorem provides an answer.

 Now, the locally convex T.V.S. can be more special. If there is only one seminorm generating the locally convex T.V.S., how can the space become? In order to make the space be Hausdorff, the seminorm need to a norm. Moreover, since completed topological space is more interesting, this special space should be completion. Therefore, we get a Banach space. And then all of above properties the general T.V.S. and locally convex T.V.S. have can be applied to the Banach space and have more powerful form. Moreover, the space consisting of all continuous maps between the Banach spaces can be equipped with more interesting structure, which can also be a Banach space with the induced norm.

 The norm generating a Banach space can be more special. If the norm, which satisfies the Parallelogram Law, can be generated by an inner product, then the Banach space with this inner product is a Hilbert space. Because of this extra inner product structure, the Hilbert space has the Projection Theorem, and thus the dual space is as same as the original space, and thus the the space consisting of all continuous maps between the same Hilbert space can contain the adjoint version of each of them. This space is the operator space.

For researching the operator space, similarly, we can firstly research a more general version. The main difference between the operator space and the Banach space is that the operator space can do multiplication, defined as composition. Moreover, this multiplication is continuous with respect to the norm topology. Therefore, the general version of the operator space is a Banach space with a extra continuous multiplication, then it becomes a Banach algebra. Comparing the Banach space, the Banach algebra has one more algebraic structure, and the invertibility is an important property with respect to this structure. Thus, the appearance of the concept of spectrum is naturally. Besides, the commutative Banach algebra can have an explicit expression. 

Besides, the operator algebra has one more operation than the general Banach algebra have, the involution. And the involution is not only continuous with respect to the norm topology. In fact, it provides an identity. That means the topology is determined by the algebraic structure. Then, the general version is $\st{C}$-algebra, whose topology is completely determined the algebraic structure it has. Because of the strong relation between the topology and the algebra, $\st{C}$-algebra has some similar properties to the complex number system. By the GNS construction, any $\st{C}$-algebra can be embedded in a operator algebra. It is amazing, since the general version of operator algebra is itself. Thus, researching operator algebras is enough.

However, the $\st{C}$-subalgebras of an operator algebra may be too small to contain enough "interesting" elements. Thus, finding a weaker topology and extending the $\st{C}$-algebra to a larger subalgebra are good ideals. But how can we do is? The Continuous Functional Calculus can provide a clue. We have known that the continuous function space on a compact is weakly dense in the bounded Borel function space and the Gelfand transform maps the continuous function space to the operator algebra. So it is natural to find a method of extending the map from the continuous function space to the bounded Borel function space. In general, we should define the operator-valued measure, thus the integral of operator makes sense. Comparing this progress to the progress embedding the continuous function space in the bounded Borel function space, the new topologies we need appeared naturally. That is the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology. Then the new algebra is born, von Neumann algebra. And in fact, these "interesting" elements are projections. And since the norm topology is determined by the algebraic structure, it can also use the algebraic properties to construct von Neumann algebras. Similarly, the structure of an abelian von Neumann algebra may be easier. There is a particular abelian von Neumann algebra, which is generated by the normal operator. By extending the Gelfand transform, the structure of this von Neumann algebra can become concrete. Moreover, any abelian von Neumann algebra has same structure.

From finite rank operators to infinite rank operators, there is a special class of operators, which can be approximated by a sequence of finite rank operators, compact operators. Because of it, compact operators has a lot of properties as similar as finite rank operators, such as the spectrum, the representations and so on. There are also some interesting classes contained in the compact operators, like the trace class. The importance of trace class is that it is the dual space of the operator algebra, and thus it can provide an extra topology on the operator algebra. This topology has some relations with the weak operator topology, and then it can provide a new method to research the von Neumann algebra. By the quotient map, there is a weak version compact operators, the Fredholm operators. So the Fredholm theory appeared. Finally, we have known that any normal operator can be diagonalizable in the finite dimensional case, but in the infinite dimensional case, we need the compact perturbation in order to get similar result. 

For the general von Neumann algebra, combining the $WOT$ and the ultraweak topology, we get more properties than a general $\st{C}$-algebra has, like the structure of the ideals. Moreover, it provides the equivalent condition the simple von Neumann algebra has, which is called factor. We have known that the von Neumann algebra is generated by all of its projections, thus these projections play an important role. By researching the relations of projections and the properties they have, it can classify von Neumann algebras into corresponding classes. In fact, these projections can be classified as abelian ones, non-abelian ones and pure infinite ones, and the corresponding von Neumann algebras are Type \RNum{1}, Type \RNum{2} and \RNum{3}. Type \RNum{1} is easier, but Type \RNum{2} and \RNum{2} do not have trivial example.
