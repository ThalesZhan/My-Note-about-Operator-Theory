\chapter{Von Neumann Algebras}

Abelian von Neuman algebras can be explicitly described as $L^{\infty}(\mu)$. For general von Neumann algebras, they have more complex structure but more interesting properties. Firstly, we have seen the relation between the $WOT$ and the ultraweak topology, therefore, the ultraweak topology can provide some different things of the von Neumann algebra. Then, since the weak closedness of von Neumann algebras, all projections in a von Neumann algebra can completely generate the whole algebra. Thus projections are fundamental elements in the von Neumann algebra. Researching the properties of them and classifying them can help us to classify general von Neumann algebras. By the properties of the projections contained in a von Neumann algebras, general von Neumann algebras can be classified as $5$ different categories and we can see that the abelian one is belong to what category.
